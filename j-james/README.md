## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We want to build a website that is a media query for desktops but has a mobile conception in mind. Over all we want to develop a responsive web design that anyone can use and enter in their own information.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
we need to run live server from root directory


## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
we used application design with mobile first in mind the primitive languages utilized were HTML, GITHUB, and CSS.
## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
we did pair programming every two iterations we would switch and implemented new changes while conceptualizing the new features to the mobile application concept.

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.
